### **Timeline**
* September 10th form teams for the event, everyone registered for the datathon will have been added to either a slack or discord so that they can communicate with each other and form teams based on their preferences


* If anyone wants to use an outside dataset which they think could support them in the competition we would ask them to upload the dataset onto the portal before September 16th


* September 16th would be the last day to register, in the evening hold an opening ceremony, and distribute materials to the teams.
    * The only materials I can think of are a template webpage for each time to use, for their submission. 

* Work on your project throughout the 48 hours, there will be occasional social activities planned for Friday night and for Saturday night before closing.

* The semi-finalists will be decided by the top 5 spots of each category based on participants voting, give time between closing and when semi-finalist are picked so that everyone has time to review each other's projects and vote.

* From the top 5 spots of each we will send 3 of the projects to the judging panel (hopefully we can get industry professionals or professors to be a part of this) these judges will determine the order of the top 3 finalists. 

* Winners will be posted on the results page of the website, individual critiques of the finalists will be sent to the finalists teams.

* Finalist will have the opportunity to give a short presentation on their final projects if they would like
