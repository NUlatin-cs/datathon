### **About Latin@CS**

Short description on Latin@CS, link to Latin@CS website

### **Theme**
With the rise of data and the prevalence of its importance in tech Latin@CS has set forward an initiative to help its community move forward in the world of data. By hosting a datathon we hope to encourage our community to explore what Northwestern looks like from the data perspective. The theme for this year is:   **Data Journalism. investigate what stories can be told from the data reported from Northwestern on an annual basis, and to investigate what assumptions and biases are present in the data.** Data is important; however, responsible use of data is equally as important. We hope to foster insightful conversations, stories, and realizations through our competition while also making competitors think about the limitations that the data has on their work.

### **Project Time**
48 Hours of time to work on the project. This 48 hours will encompass selecting a dataset from the available options, performing data analysis/exploration, and putting together a short website with whatever tools you and your team deem necessary to tell your story.

### **Project Workflow**
At the start of the event each team will be directed to the data portal unless they submitted a custom dataset for the event. Teams will have 48 hours to complete their project for the given category. As teams work through their solution it is encouraged that they regularly submit prototypes of their work to the competition. When a project is submitted to the competition it will appear under a “Projects” section which will

### **Teams**

Teams of 3-5 are acceptable. You can join the competition with any number of team members (1-5). However, if you do not have a team and would like to be matched with a team check the team matching option on the sign up sheet.

#### **Recommended Team Roles**

We recommend that teams split their members into 3 roles:
* Data Scientist - A team member who is capable of working with CSV files, performing data exploration, and has some experience with data science. This member should be helping find questions that the data can answer while also keeping track of the limitations in the dataset. 
* Writer / Designer - A team member who is capable of writing up results from data exploration and analysis. While also having an idea of how concepts should be laid out and presented to their audience.
* Front End Developer - A team member who is capable of taking the work and ideas from the Data Scientist and presenting them in a format that is easy to understand, or that can be explored by the judges of the competition. Some useful frameworks for this user may be Javascript, P5, etc…

We expect that roles will overlap throughout the competition; however, having team members who can specialize in these specific areas will be helpful for putting together a cohesive project.

### **The Data**

For the first annual Latin@CS datathon we have built a dataset approved by the Northwestern University School of Education and Social Policy. The dataset is a collection of recorded reported annually to the <a href=”https://commondataset.org/”>Common Dataset</a>. This data provides meaningful information about the university’s admissions choices, retention rates, and many other pieces of information. We encourage all participants from other universities to build and maintain a dataset containing the information from the Common Dataset. If you have any questions about how to get started reach out to us at: latin.at.cs@gmail.com. :)

### **Timeline**
* September 10th form teams for the event, everyone registered for the datathon will have been added to either a slack or discord so that they can communicate with each other and form teams based on their preferences


* If anyone wants to use an outside dataset which they think could support them in the competition we would ask them to upload the dataset onto the portal before September 16th


* September 16th would be the last day to register, in the evening hold an opening ceremony, and distribute materials to the teams.
    * The only materials I can think of are a template webpage for each time to use, for their submission. 

* Work on your project throughout the 48 hours, there will be occasional social activities planned for Friday night and for Saturday night before closing.

* The semi-finalists will be decided by the top 5 spots of each category based on participants voting, give time between closing and when semi-finalist are picked so that everyone has time to review each other's projects and vote.

* From the top 5 spots of each we will send 3 of the projects to the judging panel (hopefully we can get industry professionals or professors to be a part of this) these judges will determine the order of the top 3 finalists. 

* Winners will be posted on the results page of the website, individual critiques of the finalists will be sent to the finalists teams.

* Finalist will have the opportunity to give a short presentation on their final projects if they would like
